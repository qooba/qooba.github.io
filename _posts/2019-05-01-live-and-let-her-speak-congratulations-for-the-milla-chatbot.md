![CHATBOT]({{ site.relative_url }}assets/images/2019/04/balloon-1014411_640.jpg)

I am pleased to hear that the first Polish banking chatbot with which you can make a transfer was awarded in a competition organized by a [**Gazeta Bankowa**](https://www.gb.pl/konkursy-technologiczne-rozstrzygniete-pnews-2000.html). With Milla you can talk in the [**Bank Millennium**](https://www.bankmillennium.pl/bankowosc-elektroniczna/bankowosc-mobilna/aplikacja-mobilna-klienci-indywidualni-biznes/milla-chatbot) mobile application. Currently, Milla can speak (text to speech), listen (automatic speak recognition) and understand what you write to her (intent detection with slot filling).

This is not a sponsored post :) but I've been developing Milla for the few months and I'm really happy that I had opportunity to do this. 

Have a nice talk with Milla.
