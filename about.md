<img class="size-full wp-image-23 alignleft" src="https://qooba.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14150080.png" alt="" width="180" />Hi, my name is Kuba Sołtys, PhD.

I'm [physicist](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=IebPbgsAAAAJ&amp;hl=pl), [programmer](https://github.com/qooba) and classical singer.

I have prepared my [PhD](https://www.unipress.waw.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=730%3Adr-jakub-sotys&amp;catid=79%3Adoctorates&amp;Itemid=139&amp;lang=en) thesis at the Institute of High Pressure Polish Academy of Science.

I also worked at the [ICM UW](https://icm.edu.pl/en/) where I took part in European grants [NanoBiom](http://www.ifpan.edu.pl/nanobiom/index_en.html) and [SiCMat](http://sicmat.materials.pl/?hl=en).

Currently I work as a [Solutions Architect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qooba/) at Bank Millennium.

I love coding, investigating and learning and I hope you will find many interesting things here.
